# Cafe-Bill-Management-Project
The Cafe Billing Management System is a simple GUI-based billing system built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to input and calculate the total cost for various items in a caf√©, such as fries, burgers, drinks, and more. It also provides a summary of the order, including the subtotal, taxes, service charges, and the final total.
